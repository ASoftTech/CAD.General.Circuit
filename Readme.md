# General Circuit Schematics

## Overview

This is a collection of docs for the creation of PCB's via KiCad, as well as some schematic templates for projects. <br>
Also I've put some details here on using a LaserCutter (Manchester Hackspace one) <br>
As well as a CNC (Shapeoko2 / Ooznest OX) for making prototype PCB boards

  * Step by Step using KiCad to create a PCB
  * Using FlatCAM to create svg's for importing into Visicut
  * Step by Step using Visicut / The Manchester Hackspace Orange Laser Cutter to create PCB's
  * Using FlatCAM to create G-Code for importing into Chillipepr
  * Step by Step using Chillipepr to mill a PCB
