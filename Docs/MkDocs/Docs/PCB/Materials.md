#### Cleaning up the can

  * Use some scissors / a blade to cut the aluminum into a single sheet from the can

If we are going to use the toner transfer method then we need to remove the
epoxy resin coated on the inside of the can. This needs to be done without sanding it.

  * Heat up the metal with an iron
  * Use a paper towel soaked with acetone to rub off the paint and the interior expoxy resin
