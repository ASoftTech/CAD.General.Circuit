# Design Rules - SeedStudio

## Overview

For Seed Studio the recommended Design rules are

  * <http://support.seeedstudio.com/knowledgebase/articles/447362-fusion-pcb-specification>

Note 0.001" = 1mil

Since the minimum annular ring measurement is 4mil<br>
The minimum via diameter = 4 + 4 + 8 (drill diameter) = 16mil

## Global Settings

  * Disable the **Blind/Buried vias**
  * Disable the **Micro vias**
  * Min track width: **0.004" / 0.1016mm**
  * Min via diameter: **0.016" / 0.4064mm**
  * Min via drill diameter: **0.012" / 0.3048mm**
  * Min uvia diameter: **0.508 (unused)**
  * Min uvia drill dia: **0.127 (unused)**
