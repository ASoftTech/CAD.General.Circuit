# Making PCB's with the Laser Cutter

## Overview

This page contains a series of docs on using the Laser Cutter to make PCB's easily with different Electronic Cad Softwares. <br>
This is all based on the use of Gerbers so in theory should work with any electronic Cad software.

For homebrew PCB's there are a few different approaches.<br>
This includes the toner transfer / iron method, the toner transfer / Laminator approach (which is more accurate).

One approach is to use a laser cutter to remove paint from a Copper board, then etch the board.
This can however require a few tricks to get it right.
