## Paint the Board

First we need to thin the paint slightly

  * 1 part water to 4 parts paint
  * use of a syringe is an idea

Next spray the board. The suggestion is to use a 0.5mm nozzel

## Paint Drying

In theory we are supposed to leave the board for 24hrs to dry
Followed by a curing period in an oven for 40mins at around 130 C

TODO check smd oven profile<br>
experiment with a quick cure, then removal of solder mask before a long cure


## Cleaning solder mask areas

The areas masked with toner are removed using a combination of paint thinner and acetone, by light rubbing with a sponge.<br>
Depending on the thickness of paint, it may take a while for the solvents to take effect.

rinse the board in water afterwards to clean away the solvent
