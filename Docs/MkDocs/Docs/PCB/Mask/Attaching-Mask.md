# Attaching Mask

## Creating the stencil

First we need to create some solder mask stencils. <br>
This is exactly the same as creating stencils for the solder paste layer, except that we use the mask layer instead of the paste layer. <br>
See the stencil section for info, substituting F.Paste / B.Paste with F.Mask and B.Mask layers

## Attach Stencil

Next we're going to attach the stencil mask to the board. <br>
Spray the rear side of the stencil with Detachable spray addesive

This will help the solder mask to stick to the board and prevent any gaps from getting underneath.
The addesive needs to be non permenant. Something like 3M Remount adhesive.
It's important to not use permenant adhesive.

Next clean the PCB then attach the stencil to the board

## Black Paint Mask

Next we're going to spray some black acrylic paint over the stencil mask
This will prevent the glass paint we are using from sticking to the solder pads

## Drying the paint

Next lets dry the paint off

TODO image / try using solder oven


## Removal of mask

Next remove the solder mask
