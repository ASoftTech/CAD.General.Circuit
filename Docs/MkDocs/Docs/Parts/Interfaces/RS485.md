## RS485

The SN65HVD75D seems about the best for a RS485 interface

### Protocols

The oldest protocol for RS485 is Modbus which involves a single master / slave.
Profibus is a more modern protocol but relies on ASIC's typically to work.

### BacNet

BacNet seems to be the best open source one, see if there's a library for mbed

TODO look into STM32 port here, and try and adapt for Mbed use
